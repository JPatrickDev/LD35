Theme: Shapeshift


Infinite runner
- Each shape has a special ability
    - Have to swap between abilities to complete the level
        - One shape can jump
        - One shape can slide
Platformer/////////////////////////////////
   - Each shape has a special ability
       - Have to flick between shapes to survive a level
            - Number keys select a shape?
       - Infinite rounds like Snowbie?
       - You have a basic shape and different shapes only last a set amount of time
       - Bit like mutate?
       - Some shapes are really powerful but only last a few seconds
       - Killing the bad guys give you points towards being able to shape shift
       - Random platform level generation so the game can go on forever
       - Could also work top down?
       - Particle effects
       - Perhaps have quite a basic colour scheme (b/w?) but then the particles/weapons are quite bright, might look good
       - Bad guys have different shapes as well, to show different difficulty levels.
            - Don't have the players shapes the same as the bad guys
                - Probably can't have very many player shapes and bad guy shapes if this is the case
